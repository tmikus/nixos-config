## Installation

On a fresh installation of NixOS, clone the repository to your home folder, then edit the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` by setting the following content:

```
# Edit this configuration file to define what should be installed on
# your system.  Help is available in the configuration.nix(5) man page
# and in the NixOS manual (accessible by running ‘nixos-help’).

{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      /home/tmikus/projects/nixos-config/configuration-msi.nix
    ];

  # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
  # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
  # on your system were taken. It‘s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
  # this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
  # Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
  # (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
  system.stateVersion = "25.05"; # Did you read the comment?
}
```

Make sure to leave the `system.stateVersion` as is in the original file, or you might end up corrupting your system installation.
